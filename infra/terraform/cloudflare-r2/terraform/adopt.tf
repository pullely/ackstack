# If Cloudflare already has the bucket but the platform state does not track it
# (a first apply that created it and then lost its state write, or a recovered
# workspace), a create would fail with "bucket already exists". Look it up at
# plan time with the job's brokered credentials and import it instead. A fresh
# environment resolves to name = "" and creates normally; a bucket already in
# state short-circuits the lookup.
